# Understanding Well-Being Across Different Dimensions

*A Global Well-Being Analytics & Visualization Project using WHO + Our World in Data*

## Project Overview
This project analyzes how lifestyle behaviors, social support, work-life balance, and recreation influence overall well-being across countries. Using global datasets from WHO and Our World in Data, I built dashboards that uncover relationships between health habits, happiness, and social factors to understand what contributes to healthier and happier societies.


## Objectives

* Explore how health, lifestyle, and social factors shape well-being globally

* Identify patterns in life expectancy, happiness, and lifestyle behaviors

* Visualize cross-country comparisons to understand what drives quality of life

* Present insights in a way that supports non-technical decision-makers
